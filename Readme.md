This is a unfinished program that can draw maps through python 2.7 and R. (Created in 2016)

**This program is stopped due to time and environment reason.**

## Basic solution

The baisc solution for this is:

+ let R read .shp file and location data

+ use R to draw the points / bar plot / pie plot / density plot on the map

+ use R output .png pictures

+ use .bat files to run R files .bat -> go\*.R -> .R script

+ use .pyw to build windows program in python and create UI

+ use python run the .bat files and combine all plots layers we need.

## Environment

> python 2.7

> wxPython

> python PIL

> R package "sp" and "maptools"

## Unfinished part

Acutally, the program can only draw province level map in a national view. Other scale options are not avaliable.

--------------

Currently, I cannot run the program because I no longer use python 2.7.

Here is a snapshot of this program drawing a national point plot.
